Exploring music theory with programming

Hoping to create a pythonic music library from scratch to aid my understanding and application of music theory and programming

Far-reaching end goals:
- Chord progression generator with a spicy-ness rating
- Chord and rhythm recognition
- Rap flow recognition and generator

Potential tools and concepts that I would need to learn:
- YACC and Bison
- ML and AI
